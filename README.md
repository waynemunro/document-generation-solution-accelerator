# Document generation solution accelerator

This solution accelerator is a powerful tool that helps you create your own AI assistant for document generation. The accelerator can be used by any customer looking for reusable architecture and code snippets to build an AI assistant to generate a sample template and content grounded on their own enterprise data. 

This example focuses on a generic use case - chat with your own data, generate a document template using your own data, and exporting the document in a docx format.

### Prerequisites and costs

To deploy this solution accelerator, ensure you have access to an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) with the necessary permissions to create **resource groups, resources, app registrations, and assign roles at the resource group level**. This should include Contributor role at the subscription level and  Role Based Access Control role on the subscription and/or resource group level. Follow the steps in [Azure Account Set Up](./docs/AzureAccountSetUp.md).

Check the [Azure Products by Region](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/?products=all&regions=all) page and select a **region** where the following services are available.

Pricing varies per region and usage, so it isn't possible to predict exact costs for your usage. The majority of the Azure resources used in this infrastructure are on usage-based pricing tiers. However, Azure Container Registry has a fixed cost per registry per day.

Use the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator) to calculate the cost of this solution in your subscription. 

Review a [sample pricing sheet](https://azure.com/e/2402502429fc46429e395e0bb93d0711) in the event you want to customize and scale usage.

_Note: This is not meant to outline all costs as selected SKUs, scaled use, customizations, and integrations into your own tenant can affect the total consumption of this sample solution. The sample pricing sheet is meant to give you a starting point to customize the estimate for your specific needs._

### Security guidelines

This template uses Azure Key Vault to store all connections to communicate between resources.

This template also uses [Managed Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) for local development and deployment.

To ensure continued best practices in your own repository, we recommend that anyone creating solutions based on our templates ensure that the [Github secret scanning](https://docs.github.com/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning) setting is enabled.

You may want to consider additional security measures, such as:

* Enabling Microsoft Defender for Cloud to [secure your Azure resources](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/defender-for-cloud).
* Protecting the Azure Container Apps instance with a [firewall](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/waf-app-gateway) and/or [Virtual Network](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/networking?tabs=workload-profiles-env%2Cazure-cli).
