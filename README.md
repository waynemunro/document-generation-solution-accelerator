</details>


### Deploying

Once you've opened the project in [Codespaces](#github-codespaces) or in [Dev Containers](#vs-code-dev-containers) or [locally](#local-environment), you can deploy it to Azure following the following steps. 

To change the azd parameters from the default values, follow the steps [here](./docs/CustomizingAzdParameters.md). 


1. Login to Azure:

    ```shell
    azd auth login
    ```

    #### To authenticate with Azure Developer CLI (`azd`), use the following command with your **Tenant ID**:

    ```sh
    azd auth login --tenant-id <tenant-id>
   ```

2. Provision and deploy all the resources:

    ```shell
    azd up
    ```

3. Provide an `azd` environment name (like "bycapp")
4. Select a subscription from your Azure account, and select a location which has quota for all the resources. 
    * This deployment will take *7-10 minutes* to provision the resources in your account and set up the solution with sample data. 
    * If you get an error or timeout with deployment, changing the location can help, as there may be availability constraints for the resources.

5. Once the deployment has completed successfully, open the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/), go to the deployed resource group, find the App Service and get the app URL from `Default domain`.

6. You can now delete the resources by running `azd down`, if you are done trying out the application. 
<!-- 6. You can now proceed to run the [development server](#development-server) to test the app locally, or if you are done trying out the app, you can delete the resources by running `azd down`. -->

<h2>
Additional Steps
</h2>

1. **Add App Authentication**
   
    Follow steps in [App Authentication](./docs/AppAuthentication.md) to configure authenitcation in app service.

    Note: Authentication changes can take up to 10 minutes 

2. **Deleting Resources After a Failed Deployment**

     Follow steps in [Delete Resource Group](./docs/DeleteResourceGroup.md) If your deployment fails and you need to clean up the resources.



<!-- 

### **How to install/deploy**

1. Please check the link [Azure Products by Region](
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/?products=all&regions=all) and choose a region where Azure AI Search, Azure OpenAI Service, and Azure AI Foundry are available. If you are using the included sample data set, verify Document Intelligence (Form Recognizer) is available.

2. Click the following deployment button to create the required resources for this accelerator in your Azure Subscription.

   [![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmicrosoft%2Fdocument-generation-solution-accelerator%2Fmain%2Finfrastructure%2Fdeployment.json)

3. You will need to select an Azure Subscription, create/select a Resource group, and Region. If your intention is to deploy this solution accelerator and the corresponding sample data set, the default settings will suffice.

If you are using your own data, the next step is optional.

4. Follow steps in [Sample data guide](./scripts/SAMPLE_DATA.md) to ingest the sample Promissory Note PDFs into the search index.

If you want to enable authentication, you will need to add an identity provider.

#### Add an identity provider
After deployment, you will need to add an identity provider to provide authentication support in your app. See [this tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/scenario-secure-app-authentication-app-service) for more information.

If you don't add an identity provider, the chat functionality will allow anyone to access the chat functionality of your app. **This is not recommended for production apps.** To enable this restriction, you can add `AUTH_ENABLED=True` to the environment variables. This will enable authentication and prevent unauthorized access to the chat functionality of your app.

To add further access controls, update the logic in `getUserInfoList` in `frontend/src/pages/chat/Chat.tsx`. 

#### Recommended practices
1. **For enhanced relevance and accuracy**, we recommend implementing [Azure hybrid search](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/hybrid-search-overview) over full-text search. Azure hybrid search provides superior relevance, accuracy, support for complex queries, improved user experience, scalability, performance, advanced features, and integration with AI services. These advantages make it the ideal choice for modern applications that require robust and intelligent search capabilities.
2. **Importance of prompt engineering**. Prompt engineering is a critical aspect of working with AI models, especially when leveraging advanced capabilities such as those provided by Azure AI services. Proper prompt engineering ensures that the AI models generate accurate, relevant, and contextually appropriate responses. It involves carefully crafting and refining prompts to guide the model's behavior and output effectively. Neglecting prompt engineering can result in suboptimal performance, irrelevant outputs, and increased frustration for users. Therefore, it is essential to invest time and effort in prompt engineering to fully harness the potential of AI models
