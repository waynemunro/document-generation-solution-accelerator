# Deployment Guide

## **Pre-requisites**

To deploy this solution accelerator, ensure you have access to an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) with the necessary permissions to create **resource groups, resources, app registrations, and assign roles at the resource group level**. This should include Contributor role at the subscription level and  Role Based Access Control role on the subscription and/or resource group level. Follow the steps in [Azure Account Set Up](./AzureAccountSetUp.md).

Check the [Azure Products by Region](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/?products=all&regions=all) page and select a **region** where the following services are available:

- Azure OpenAI Service
- Azure AI Search
- [Azure Semantic Search](./AzureSemanticSearchRegion.md)  

Here are some example regions where the services are available: East US, East US2, Australia East, UK South, France Central.

### **Important Note for PowerShell Users**

If you encounter issues running PowerShell scripts due to the policy of not being digitally signed, you can temporarily adjust the `ExecutionPolicy` by running the following command in an elevated PowerShell session:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```

This will allow the scripts to run for the current session without permanently changing your system's policy.

## Deployment Options & Steps

### Sandbox or WAF Aligned Deployment Options

The [`infra`](../infra) folder of the Multi Agent Solution Accelerator contains the [`main.bicep`](../infra/main.bicep) Bicep script, which defines all Azure infrastructure components for this solution.

By default, the `azd up` command uses the [`main.parameters.json`](../infra/main.parameters.json) file to deploy the solution. This file is pre-configured for a **sandbox environment** — ideal for development and proof-of-concept scenarios, with minimal security and cost controls for rapid iteration.

For **production deployments**, the repository also provides [`main.waf.parameters.json`](../infra/main.waf.parameters.json), which applies a [Well-Architected Framework (WAF) aligned](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/well-architected/) configuration. This option enables additional Azure best practices for reliability, security, cost optimization, operational excellence, and performance efficiency, such as:

  - Enhanced network security (e.g., Network protection with private endpoints)
  - Stricter access controls and managed identities
  - Logging, monitoring, and diagnostics enabled by default
  - Resource tagging and cost management recommendations

**How to choose your deployment configuration:**

* Use the default `main.parameters.json` file for a **sandbox/dev environment**
* For a **WAF-aligned, production-ready deployment**, copy the contents of `main.waf.parameters.json` into `main.parameters.json` before running `azd up`

---

### VM Credentials Configuration

By default, the solution sets the VM administrator username and password from environment variables.

To set your own VM credentials before deployment, use:

```sh
azd env set AZURE_ENV_VM_ADMIN_USERNAME <your-username>
azd env set AZURE_ENV_VM_ADMIN_PASSWORD <your-password>
```

> [!TIP]
> Always review and adjust parameter values (such as region, capacity, security settings and log analytics workspace configuration) to match your organization’s requirements before deploying. For production, ensure you have sufficient quota and follow the principle of least privilege for all identities and role assignments.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> The WAF-aligned configuration is under active development. More Azure Well-Architected recommendations will be added in future updates.

Consider the following settings during your deployment to modify specific settings:

<details>
  <summary><b>Configurable Deployment Settings</b></summary>

When you start the deployment, most parameters will have **default values**, but you can update the following settings:[here](../docs/CustomizingAzdParameters.md):

| **Setting**                          | **Description**                                                                               | **Default Value**        |

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>[Optional] Quota Recommendations</b></summary>

By default, the _Gpt-4.1 model capacity_ in deployment is set to _30k tokens_, so we recommend:
- **For Global Standard | GPT-4.1** - the capacity to at least 150k tokens post-deployment for optimal performance.

- **For Standard | GPT-4** - ensure a minimum of 30k–40k tokens for best results.

To adjust quota settings, follow these [steps](./AzureGPTQuotaSettings.md).

### ⚠️ Important: Check Azure OpenAI Quota Availability  

➡️ To ensure sufficient quota is available in your subscription, please follow **[Quota check instructions guide](./QuotaCheck.md)** before you deploy the solution. Insufficient quota can cause deployment errors. Please ensure you have the recommended capacity or request additional capacity before deploying this solution.

### Deploying with AZD

Once you've opened the project in [Codespaces](#github-codespaces), [Dev Containers](#vs-code-dev-containers), or [locally](#local-environment), you can deploy it to Azure by following these steps:

1. Login to Azure:

    ```shell
    azd auth login
    ```

    #### To authenticate with Azure Developer CLI (`azd`), use the following command with your **Tenant ID**:

    ```sh
    azd auth login --tenant-id <tenant-id>
    ```

2. Provision and deploy all the resources:

    ```shell
    azd up
    ```

3. Provide an `azd` environment name (e.g., "dgapp").
4. Select a subscription from your Azure account and choose a location that has quota for all the resources. 
    - This deployment will take *7-10 minutes* to provision the resources in your account and set up the solution with sample data.
    - If you encounter an error or timeout during deployment, changing the location may help, as there could be availability constraints for the resources.

5. Once the deployment has completed successfully and you would like to use the sample data, run the bash command printed in the terminal. The bash command will look like the following: 
    ```shell 
    bash ./infra/scripts/process_sample_data.sh
    ```
    If you don't have azd env then you need to pass parameters along with the command. Then the command will look like the following:
    ```shell 
    bash ./infra/scripts/process_sample_data.sh <Storage-Account-Name> <Storage-Container-Name> <Key-Vault-Name> <CosmosDB-Account-Name> <Resource-Group-Name> <Search-Service-Name> <Managed-Identity-Client-ID> <AI-Foundry-Resource-ID>
    ```

6. Open the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/), go to the deployed resource group, find the App Service and get the app URL from `Default domain`.

7. You can now delete the resources by running `azd down`, if you are done trying out the application. 

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting
 If you encounter any issues during the deployment process, please refer  [troubleshooting](../docs/TroubleShootingSteps.md) document for detailed steps and solutions

## Post Deployment Steps

1. **Add App Authentication**

     > Note: Authentication changes can take up to 10 minutes 

    Follow steps in [App Authentication](./AppAuthentication.md) to configure authentication in app service.

2. **Deleting Resources After a Failed Deployment**  

     - Follow steps in [Delete Resource Group](./DeleteResourceGroup.md) if your deployment fails and/or you need to clean up the resources.

## Environment configuration for local development & debugging
> Set APP_ENV in your .env file to control Azure authentication. Set the environment variable to dev to use Azure CLI credentials, or to prod to use Managed Identity for production. **Ensure you're logged in via az login when using dev in local**.
To configure your environment, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the `src` folder.
2. Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.sample` file.
3. Fill in the `.env` file using the deployment output or by checking the Azure Portal under "Deployments" in your resource group.
4. Alternatively, if resources were
   provisioned using `azd provision` or `azd up`, a `.env` file is automatically generated in the `.azure/<env-name>/.env`
   file. To get your `<env-name>` run `azd env list` to see which env is default.
5. Ensure that `APP_ENV` is set to "**dev**" in your `.env` file.
